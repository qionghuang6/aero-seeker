This is a Next.js website for seeking out planes near a chosen location. It finds planes near a given location using the [OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/) and displays them on Google Maps. Each plane's callsign, coordinates, speed and ICAO24 code are also displayed. 

This is currently hosted on https://aero-seeker.vercel.app/
